How to install the GoBoard plugin? There are several ways to do this.

## Through the Obsidian application (recommended)

1. In the Obsidian application, open the community plugins settings: `Settings -> Community plugins`.
2. If you haven't done this yet, you'll need to enable support for third-party plugins `Turn on community plugins`.
3. Go to plugin selection by clicking `Browse`.
4. In the search bar, enter `GoBoard`.
5. Select the plugin, click `Install`, and after installation is complete - `Enable`.
6. Done, now you can draw diagrams!

## Using BRAT

If for some reason installation through the Obsidian interface doesn't work for you,
you can install GoBoard via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

1. Make sure you have [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) installed. If not - [install it](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=BRAT).
2. In the BRAT plugin settings, add the repository `https://github.com/dsokolov/goboard`, following the [instructions](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).
3. Done, now you can draw diagrams!

## Manually

1. Choose a [suitable release](https://github.com/dsokolov/goboard/releases) and download 3 files from it: `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css`.
2. Copy these files to your vault, in the directory `<vault_root>/.obsidian/plugins/goboard/`. If such directories don't exist - create them.
3. In Obsidian settings, enable community plugins support (if not already enabled).
4. In the plugins list, find and enable `GoBoard`. You may need to restart Obsidian.
5. Done, now you can draw diagrams!
